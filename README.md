# SuperRaspi8
Autonomus Digital super 8 cartridge 

### Introduction
The SuperRaspi8 is yet another free and opensource Raspberry Pi based digital super 8 cartridge, but with a Twist !
It will be the first entierly autonomous cartridge. No phone, no internet connection to control the recording of the video.
The cartridge will work directly with the buildin camera motor and trigger.

## This is what the SuperRaspi8 is composed of :

 **1** : Custom 3d printed Super8 Cartridge that fit every super8 camera
 
 **2** : Raspberry pi Zero
 
 **3** : Raspberry Pi Zero W Camera
 
 **4** : USB key for stocking video files and quickly transfer them to a computer
 
 **5** : Battery pack
 
 **6** : Some part to make the camera autonomous that i will make public when the documentation will be ready ;)
 
## Progression
The project is still in early developpement but the biggest feature (using the building trigger to control recording) is already in an advanced stage. 
the first draft of the Program and the firsts practical prototypes of the systems are already promising and show that the project is doable. 

The next step is going to be optical challenges so it's probably going to take some time.
