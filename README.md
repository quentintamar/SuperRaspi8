# SuperRaspi8
Autonomus Digital super 8 cartridge 

## Introduction
The SuperRaspi8 is yet another Raspberry Pi based digital super 8 cartridge, but with a Twist !
It will be the first entierly autonomous cartridge. No phone, no internet connection to control the recording of the video.
The cartridge will work directly with the buildin camera motor and trigger.
